# all lines starting with # or blank ones are ignored ,,,,,
# the nearest neighbor parameters are taken out of J. SantaLucia's original publications,,,,,
# only the W-C, single internal mismatch and dangling ends are valid here ,,,,,
# thus the name 'S',,,,,
#,,,,,
# each table of nearest neighbor parameters contains a 6X6 grid,,,,,
# without any interrupting comments,,,,,
# the D in the nearest neighbor denotes position opposite to the dangling end,,,,,
#,,,,,
# each grid is for a different closing W-C pair, i.e., AT, TA, CG and GC ,,,,,
# the parameter grid is tab delimited or comma delimited,,,,,
#,,,,,
# The nearest neighbors in the first column are 5'->3' ,,,,,
# The nearest neighbors in the corresponding columns are 3'->5' ,,,,,
#,,,,,
# this table is for the entropy,,,,,
